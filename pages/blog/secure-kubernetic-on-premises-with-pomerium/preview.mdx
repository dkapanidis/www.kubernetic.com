Deploy Kubernetic on-premises and secure it using Pomerium.

With Kubernetic Team you can now deploy Kubernetic on your own cluster. In previous [blog post](/blog/running-securely-kubernetic-on-premises-with-identity-aware-proxy) we discussed how to secure it on GKE using Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP). In this blog weâ€™ll extend on that by running Pomerium as Identity-Aware Proxy on your own cluster so that you can deploy it anywhere.
