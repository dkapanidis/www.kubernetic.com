We started Kubernetic as a desktop app early-on for Kubernetes, because we saw the potential of Kubernetes itself for power users, but also the complexity it poses for newcomers and it steep learning curve, so we’ve built it focusing on two main factors, **productivity** for power users and **discoverability** for newcomers.

Today, we release v3.1.0, with a theme. A main feature that is a bit of-course of those two factors, but our users (that’s you) have asked for it and we couldn’t resist the temptation to satisfy you, so here you have it, but don’t worry cause we have other treats as well, just keep reading.

## Dark Mode :sunglasses: is here!

Now you can toggle dark mode from preferences, and say bye-bye to eye strain.
