Last week we released [Kubernetic 3.1.0](/blog/release-3-1-0) the desktop edition of a single-pane of glass to manage your kubernetes resources. Today we’re releasing the Kubernetic Team edition, deployed on-premises on your own cluster, and we’ll go through the process of securing the installation using [Google Cloud’s Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP](https://cloud.google.com/iap).
